send buy and sell information to mongo: {ticker, sharenum, shareprice, date} as packets
multiple packets can be stored as a portfolio
store user data as a document in a collection, a document can hold multiple poftolios 
(assume this portfolios have date in them)
{id (manadatory), username, hashed password??, portfolios:
					firstPortfolio: [{swn, 3, $5.60}, {aapl, 5, $121}, {tsla, 10, $40}]
					secondPortfolio: [{msft, 19, $70}, {pltr, 4, $100}],
balance: 40,000
}

update and save buying information when needed

current earnings are determined by:
earnings = 0
for packet in portfolio:
	sum += (marketprice(ticker) * sharenum) - (shareprice * sharenum)
return earnings

signup: just a username and a password, make sure duplicate usernames are not allowed, check mongo for usernames, after succesful sign up, create mongo collection {id (manadatory), username, hashed password??} you can add portfolio field later: https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/operator/aggregation/addFields/
check this for reference: https://kb.objectrocket.com/mongo-db/mongodb-null-or-empty-a-look-at-some-edge-cases-for-mongodb-and-how-to-query-for-them-470
